Once cooled, you can easily slice it and freeze it to always have some slices on hand. You will be astonished by the homemade taste and its fluffy texture."

This gluten free and vegan bread (yes vegan, because 90% of the gluten free bread recipes out there contains eggs or even mozzarella cheese, what a shame!) is born to make you happy with a sandwich. Its softness and  homemade bread aroma are incredible with salmon and avocado. Delicious with soups, it's even better toasted and served hot with butter and jam.

__Ingredients for a little loaf:__

> - 100 g rice flour
> - 50 g corn starch
> - 5 g psyllium husk
> - 1 tsp dry yeast
> - a pinch of salt
> - 200 ml water
> - sesame or poppy seeds


1. Warm the water and use a small quantity to melt the dry yeast in a little bowl, then set aside. 
2. Combine in a large bowl the rice flour, starch, salt and psyllium husk, then, using a spoon, stir the left water into the dry ingredients until it forms a sticky dough.
3. Add the yeast with all its water, then bring it together with the spoon into a ball. Cover it with a damp tea towel, then leave the dough in a warm place for 3 to 5 hours.
4. Preheat the oven to 220ºC/430ºF.
5. Once risen, place the dough in a 16cm*10cm loaf pan, sprinkle with poppy seeds, sesame seeds or other any seed you prefer.
6. Bake it in the hot oven for around 30 minutes, until it's golden brown.
7. Leave to cool slightly on a wire cooling rack, then slice and serve.
