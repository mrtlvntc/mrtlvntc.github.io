Welcome to the perfect recipe of a fool proof gluten free shortbread recipe, involving almonds who give a fine elegant touch to the dough taste. I already made these biscuits for non gluten free people and anyone ever notice any difference, so no need for explanations. This is a basic recipe you can customize and adapt to your favorite flavors. Needless to say, these cookies are a great gift for Christmas, birthdays and every other time you have to come up with a last minute homemade present. The ingredients involve only natural gluten free flours you probably already have at home.
