These biscuits have been in every Italian children breakfast, half awaken with a handful of them dipped in milk or tea every morning. They are called Campagnole.

In search of a Proustian rush I tried to make a gluten free version and let’s say it turned out pretty well! The original recipe is from Ilaria, owner of Non Solo Piccante blog.

Warning:
The dough have to rest for two hours in fridge, so be prepared.


__Ingredients for 30 biscuits__

> - 6 oz / 170 gr rice flour
> - 2 oz / 50 gr potato starch or corn starch
> - 3 oz / 70 gr chestnut flour
> - 6 tbsp / 50 gr coconut milk
> - 3,5 oz / 90 gr soften butter
> - 3,5 oz brown sugar
> - 1 happy egg
> - 1,5 tsp baking powder  
> - 1 vanilla bean
> - salt

1. Take two bowls: in one mix all the flours with the baking powder and a pinch of salt. In the second bowl whip soften butter with sugar until you reach a soft texture. Add the egg and keep whisking.  Warm the coconut milk with the vanilla seeds.
2. Add to the butter bowl half of the flours and half of the milk. Mix it well and repeat.
3. When the dough is smooth, put it on a baking sheet in a rectangular plum cake mold  (approx. 10 cm x 25 cm) and leave it in the fridge for at least 2 hours.
4. When the dough is well solid, lay it on a cutting board and cut it into slices (5 mm) with a quite big knife and a steady hand. This will give an excellent texture to our biscuits.
5. Bake at 350°F ( 180°C ) for 18 minutes.
6. Stare at them until cool to avoid biscuits robberies.
