No more waste while making a pumpkin soup: all the seeds and pulp that are usually thrown away can be used to make a crunchy granola to add!
Here's the easy and quick recipe for a great dairy free and gluten free soup to warm up you rainy fall dinner.

__Ingredients for two:__

> - a pinch of salt
> - 200 ml water
> - sage leaves


1. Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F.
2. Cut your pumpkin in 1 cm thin slices. If it’s organic, you can leave the skin on.
3. Separate the seeds and the pulp around them. Chop the down to little pieces.
4. Add to the seeds mixture the hazelnut flour, the buckwheat flakes, chopped sage leaves, and salt. Mix with a spoon and add a tablespoon of oil or two if it doesn’t hold together. It has to stay together in chunks, that will become our granola chunks.
5. Place the pumpkin slices on a tray with parchment paper and drizzle them with some oil, then add some sage leaves. Place the tray on the bottom of the oven.
6. Place on another tray the granola mixture well layered and spaced here and there. Place the tray on the higher level of the oven.
