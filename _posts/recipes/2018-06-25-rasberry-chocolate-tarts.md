Chocolate and raspberries is one of my favorite match. Often (most of the time actually) in my ice cream cone, sometimes also in my dessert recipes. Like in these so-chocolatey little tarts, perfect for a summer dessert, you can also prepare them in advance and then fill with cream and fruits at the last minute.

The pie crust is naturally vegan and gluten free, which is good when you have friends over and don't know their preferences. Chocolate cream custard is vegan as well, yet fresh and delicious.

__Prepare the tarts cocoa crust__
1. In a bowl pour the flours, sugar, baking powder, cocoa, and cornstarch. Mix everything well with a whisk.
2. Pour the olive oil and mix until it becomes a crumbling texture.
3. Pour slowly the almond milk and continue to mix, removing all lumps.   4. When the batter begins to have a shape, pour it all on a work surface and start working it with your hands, until you get a smooth, soft and sticky dough.
5. Form a ball and wrap it in the film. Let it rest in the fridge for one hour.
6. During this time, proceed with the custard cream just below.
7. When the dough is nice and solid, place it between two parchment papers and flatten it into a 5mm thick disk.
8. Preheat oven to 180C and place rack in the middle.
9. Cut the dough in 4 disks and line them in the tart pans, pressing it against the rim.
10. Bake for 20 minutes and then let them cool completely.

__Chocolate cream custard__
1. Chop the chocolate in chunks. It could be 70% - 90% chocolate, according to taste.
2. Mix a small amount of the milk with the cornstarch until even.
3. Heat the left milk along with the sugar and cocoa. When itâ€™s hot, ass the chocolate chunks.
4. Bring together the cornstarch and mix well. Turn off and let the cream cool completely. It will become firmer cooling down.
5. When the chocolate cream is cold, put it in a pastry bag and fill the tarts. Complete with raspberries.
