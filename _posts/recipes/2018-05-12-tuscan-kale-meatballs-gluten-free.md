If you’re looking for a hearty and decadently satisfying vegetarian meal, you are in the right place. This no-meat meatballs are easy to make, extremely tasty and full of vitamins, too. Tuscan kale, known in Italy as cavolo nero (black kale), is among the most antioxidant-rich foods you could reach, high in vitamins and minerals including lutein, vitamins A, C, K, fibre, calcium, manganese and iron. Anyway, if you can’t find it, you can use the more common curly kale instead.

__Ingredients for 2__

> - 250 gr / 8.8 oz Tuscan kale / curly kale
> - 250 gr / 8.8 oz steamed potatoes
> - 70 gr / 2.4 oz gluten free bread crumbs
> - 40 gr / 1.5 oz of Parmesan cheese or aged Pecorino cheese
> - Extra-virgin olive oil, salt, garlic


1. Steam peeled potatoes until soft.
2. Chop the kale in little pieces and stir fry it in pan with a drizzle of oil and a garlic clove, until soft (add a couple spoons of water if the kale is particularly tough).
3. Remove the garlic and blend the two vegetables in a mixer, adding a tablespoon of olive oil, a pinch of salt, grated cheese (saving one tablespoon) and the breadcrumbs ((saving one 5. tablespoon).
4. Turn on the oven at 170°C / 340°F.
5. When the dough is warm, shape 8 big meatballs with hands and roll them in the leftover bread.
6. Sprinkle with some more oil and bake the meatballs for 15 minutes at 170°C / 340°F.
7. Remove
8. Cover with the leftover grated cheese and enjoy the softness.
9. Keep in mind that if you can resist, the day after these balls are even better!
