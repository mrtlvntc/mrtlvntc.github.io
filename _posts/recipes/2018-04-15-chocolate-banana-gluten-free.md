I made this double chocolate banana bread so many times I could say it has become a family recipe! The fudgy and melting texture of every slice is perfect for your breakfast or afternoon tea. This banana bread is easy and fast to prepare and remains soft for a week, but usually it's gone in two or three days. Even better, it's plant based and made only with natural flours.   

__Wet ingredients__
> - 2 tsp ground chia (mix them with 2 tbsp hot water)
> - 360 ml mashed ripe bananas (about 3 medium)
> - 120 ml plant milk
> - 90 ml + 2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
> - 180 gr / 6,3 oz brown sugar
> - 60 ml rhum (optional)

__Dry ingredients__
> - 120 gr / 4,2 oz buckwheat flour
> - 35 gr / 1,2 oz rice flour
> - 25 gr / 1 oz cornstarch
> - ½ tsp baking soda
> - 1 tsp baking powder
> - 120 gr / 4,2 cacao powder
> - ¼ tsp fine sea salt
> - 100 gr / 3,5 oz chocolate
> - some chopped walnuts (optional)

1. Place ground chia seeds in a small bowl with 2 tablespoons of hot water and set aside for a few minutes.
2. Mix all buckwheat flour, rice flour, cornstarch, baking soda, baking powder, cacao and salt  in a medium mixing bowl with a whisk.
3. Mash well the bananas, mix them with coconut milk, olive oil, sugar, rhum and the chia jelly in a bowl.
4. Put all the dried ingredients into the wet ones and mix them until any lumps is gone.
5. Heat up the oven to 175° C / 350° F and cover a plumcake tin with parchment paper.
6. At last, put the chocolate chopped in small pieces into the batter.
7. Transfer the batter to the plumcake tin and sprinkle the top with wallnuts.
8. Bake in a pre-heated oven for about 65-70 minutes, until a skewer comes out clean.
9. Cool before removing from the tin and slicing.
10. Start to wait for next breakfast!
