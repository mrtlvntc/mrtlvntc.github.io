An almonds based galette with a fruity filling: I used peaches but it's good with apples or apricots, too.  This simple recipe requires some manual skills to form the galette shape, but don't worry, just pay attention to the process and the photos.

__Ingredients:__

> - 150 gr almonds
> - 1 apple (150 gr)
> - 2 peaches
> - 2 spoons tahini or other seed butter
> - optional: chopped hazelnuts/almonds


1. Soak the almonds in lukewarm water for 30 minutes. Pre-heat your oven to 200째C / 400째F.
2. Peel and remove the seeds from an apple, then blend it until it becomes creamy.
3. Remove water from the almonds and ground them untile they are finely granular, but not yet powder/flour.
4. Mix the almonds with mashed apple and one spoon of seed butter, I chose tahini but also peanut butter makes a great job here.
5. Place the dough between two parchment papers and press it with a rolling pin or with the bottom of a glass. If any parts of dough come off, just stick it to the main piece and roll it again, trying to get a round like thin layer.
6. Remove the paper above and spread the left seed butter spoon in the center of the dough.
7. Cut the peaches in thin slices and place them evenly on your pastry, leaving 2-3 cm from the border free.  
8. Holding the parchment paper, fold the borders of your dough on the filling.
9. Optional: you can sprinkle the tart with sliced almonds or chopped hazelnuts.
10. Bake at 200째C / 400째F for 45 minutes. Allow to cool down completely.
