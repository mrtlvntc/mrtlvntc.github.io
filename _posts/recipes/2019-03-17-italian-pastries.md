outcome: "Blueberries, raspberries and strawberries: how generous and creative the nature has been. Choose your favourite to put on these little gluten free fresh fruits tarts and serve them for your afternoon tea: everyone will be delighted. This simple Italian recipe can be made in advance and can be kept in the fridge for 3-4 days. For a winter edition, forget about the fresh fruits and add some chocolate in the custard, then sprinkle with toasted hazelnuts and almonds. My gluten free shortcrust has only natural flours in its ingredients and doesn't need pre-mixed flours. Basically, you have no excuse not to do these little cuties for your next tea party! "

The perfect balance between the delicious custard, the crunchy tart shell and the fresh red fruits made these little pastries one of my favorites desserts. Italian bakeries make these also with kiwi, but let's be serious, who would choose a kiwi instead of a berry?

__Ingredients for 24 tart shells:__

> - 120 g  / 4,2 oz soft butter
> - 50 g / 4 tbsp cane sugar
> - 1 happy egg
> - 120 g / 4,2 oz almond flour
> - 180 g / 6,3 oz rice flour
> - 90 g / 3,2 cornstarch
> - 1/4 tsp salt

__Ingredients for the filling:__

> - 2 egg yolks
> - 30 g / 4 tbsp cornstarch
> - 70 g / 6 tbsp cane sugar
> - 250 ml / 1,5 cup sugarless almond milk
> - 1 vanilla bean OR lemon zest
> - 125 g / 0,5 cup red fruits

1. Let's start with the shells: whip the softened butter and sugar until light and fluffy.
2. Add the egg and mix well, then add all the other ingredients until you reach a uniform texture.
3. Make a dough brick and let it rest in the fridge for 30 minutes.
4. Meanwhile, let's think about the custard filling: in a milk pan, whip the egg yolks and the sugar until they become light yellow.
5. Add the milk little by little in order to get an uniform texture.
6. Open the vanilla bean, put the seeds and the empty bean in the milk cream OR add the lemon zest (according to your taste).
7. Put the milk on the stove and heat it, stirring well, until it becomes thick. Remove from the fire and put it aside to chill.
8. Pre-heat the oven to 170Â°C / 340Â°F.
9. Grease a mini muffin mold with butter and a little cornstarch.
10. Roll out the pastry 2-3 mm thick and line the muffin tin.
11. Bake the shells for 25 minutes, until golden. No need for beans or baking weights, as there's no gluten in the ingredients, the pastry will remain the same size.
12. Once the shells are chilled, fill them with the custard cream and fresh fruits according to your preferences.
13. Try to save some for your guests ðŸ˜¬
