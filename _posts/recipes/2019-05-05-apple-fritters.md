outcome: "Even though is typical to think of these pastries around the Carnival period, my grandmother used to fry some of these fritters every now and then. It was really difficult to wait for them to cool down with their smell all over the kitchen!
<b> The batter is naturally gluten free and dairy free, so suitable for celiacs and lactose intolerant (check always the labels of your ingredients). You can use the apple variety you prefer, I usually choose a little sour one to give these cute balls a tangy punch. "
