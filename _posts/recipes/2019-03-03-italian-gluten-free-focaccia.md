outcome: "Focaccia is a real pillar of Italian street food. It changes so much from North to South. It can be thin and crusty, or tall and soft. This recipe is the Italian focaccia you can find in every bakery, soften filled with Italian prosciutto or mozzarella and tomatoes.
With this basic gluten free recipe you can have fun and come up with your own version: I strongly suggest that you top it with cherry tomatoes and olives, like the use to do in Puglia. Using only naturally gluten free flours and no premixed ingredients, this focaccia recipe is a no brainer for every weekend baking wish."

Italian focaccia is one of my favourite things in the world. After going gluten free, I missed so much that little slice of heaven I used to have as breakfast, lunch, and sometimes also midnight snack.
It took me almost 3 years of attempts to get the right texture that remains soft and tasty for two or three days (but will definitely ends before).

_Ingredients for 12 slices_

> - 200 gr / 1,5 cup rice flour  
> - 100 gr /  3/4 cup chickpeas flour
> - 100 gr /  3/4 cup corn starch
> - 10 gr psyllium husk
> - 5 gr / half a tsp dry yeast
> - 400 ml of warm water
> - 20 ml extra virgin olive oil
> - rosemary
> - salt

1. Melt the yeast in warm water and let it rest aside.
2. Mix the flours in a large bowl with 5 grams (half a tsp) of salt and psyllium husk.
3. Add all the water and whisk well to get a smooth dough. It will be quite liquid and that's right!  
4. Let the loaf rest in its bowl for 3 hours at a warm temperature, around 30°C/90°F.
5. After this first rising, transfer the dough in a 33 x 23 cm pan covered in parchment paper slightly oiled. Leave it here for 1 hour at warm temperature.
6. Preheat the oven at 220°C / 430°F.
7. After the second rising, mix in a little bowl 20 ml of extra virgin olive oil, 20 ml of water and 5 grams of salt.
8. Grease your fingers with some of the oily mix and punch several little holes in your focaccia dough. Then pour the remaining oil in the holes. Add extra salt on top if you like it salty.
9. Sparkle some rosemary leaves on top and bake at 220°C / 430°F for 25 minutes.
