I worked on this recipe from my mother to get an easy way to make a fish soupe wich was worth the most elegant dinner, yet super fast to put together. And this final result, you can believe me, will become your no-brain recipe for your romantic dinners. 
You can choose the main fish you prefer, mine is monkfish for this recipe. But it works well also with cod, bream or sea bass. 

__Ingredients for 2__

> - 150 gr /  0,5 oz of fish filet of choice  
> - 100 gr / 1 handful fresh prawns  
> - 150 gr /  0,5 oz of clean squids
> - 120 gr / 1,25 cup of cherry tomatoes (or tomato sauce if not in season)
> - half a white onion
> - a clove of garlic
> - 150 ml of dry white wine
> - 150 ml of still water
> - extra virgin olive oil, salt, chili pepper
> - parsley 

1. Heat a medium pot with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and add the onion finely chopped, the garlic clove and the chili pepper (according to your taste). 
2. Clean the prawns and chop them in 3 cm sized bites. Make the same size bites out of the fish filet and the squids. 
3. When the onion becomes translucent add the tomatoes, the wine and the water. 
4. Cook on medium heat for 10 minutes, then remove the garlic and blend everything with a mixer. 
5. Add the fish filet, immediately after the squids and then the prawns, in this order. 
6. Add some chopped parsley, cover and cook for 10 minutes.  
7. Let the soup rest and cool down for 10 minutes to let the flavors melt together and then serve.
