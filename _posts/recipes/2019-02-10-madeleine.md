outcome: "I know you are thinking you do not need a madeleine specific mold, but trust me: you do. Make these little treats will take your pastry knowledge to the next step. And they're so easy to do, just make sure to wait the fridge rest.
This gluten free version of madeleine is well tested and will make your tea moment extremely elegant, in a French way. They get along really well with a light infusion such as linden or dandelion, or even with a strong espresso. Madeleine work great also for breakfast or late night snack (but you shouldn't do this, I never do this actually)."

The scent of honey, its bright colour and that little winking bump: all the details of a madeleine make it the perfect pastry. A symbol of the *patisserie française*, the madeleines are also easy to bake, you just need the time to let the dough rest in the fridge. We'll see this in the procedure. As this is a simple recipe based on few ingredients, be sure to choose high quality ingredients to get the best result.
