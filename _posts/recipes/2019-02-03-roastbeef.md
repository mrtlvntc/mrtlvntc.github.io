outcome: "Here in France (and in Italy as well) the butcher sell directly a meat chunk called \"roast beef\" but you can use also filet (a little more expensive) or silvertop. If the cut comes without any fat on it, I suggest to add a little extra lard on the side, as you see in the photos.
This is a naturally gluten free and paleo recipe. This essential and traditional meat dish is a good idea for a dinner with friends, can be made in advance and lightly warmed up at the right moment."

A few high quality ingredients are the good starting point for most of the recipes. Especially when it comes to meat or fish as star of the dish. Here, a good quality meat is enhanced by the subtle flavour of the herbs and a drop of white wine.
This roast beef recipe has been passed on from generations to my mother-in-law as a family well kept secret. It's a special moment when a new family begins and finds the union of two recipes traditions, like in my case.

__Ingredients__

> - 800 gr. of roast-beef meat, well tied-up
> - 1 tbsp unsalted quality butter
> - 1 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
> - 2 sage leaves
> - 1 bay leaf
> - a little rosemary branch
> - a bit of parsley  
> - 100 ml dry white wine
> - sea salt
> - 1 garlic clove

1. Keep the meat out of the fridge for three hours and begin to cook it when it's room temperature.
2. In a medium saucepan, melt the butter with the evo oil and add the herbs.
3. On a high temperature add the entire roast beef to the saucepan and flip it on each side of the piece to seal it, 1-2 minutes for each side.
4. When sealed, add the wine and let it evaporate.
5. Keep the meat on medium heat for 10 minutes for each side, for a total of 40 minutes. The beef will be well roasted on the outside and pink at the core.
6. Remove from heat and add salt to your taste.
7. Let it cool for at least 30 minutes and slice it very thin to get the most tenderness.
8. Enjoy with your favourite greens, but even more the day after in a sandwich with lettuce, tomatoes and a spread of mustard.
9. Extra tip: while you wait to your roast beef to cool down, you can collect the meat juice and use it on oven roasted potatoes.
