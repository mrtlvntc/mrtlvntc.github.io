This is a good and easy way to use mackerel, which is often considered a low-value sea food alternative, yet it's a great fish with a high nutritional profile. You just need to know how to cook it well!

__Ingredients for 2__

> - 300 gr/ 10 oz salad of your choice
> - 1 kg / 35 oz (4 medium) fresh mackerel
> - fresh persil, mint, basil and rosemary
> - capers
> - organic lemon and oranges
> - extra virgin olive oil


1. Free mackerels from their entrails.
2. Prepare a pot of boiling water with one organic lemon and one organic orange sliced.
3. Add some salt and the whole mackerels.
4. Boil them for 20 minutes. Drain and let them cool.
5. Remove the skin and the bones from the fishes, getting some nice fillets.
6. Place the cleaned mackerel fillets in a casserole with some good extra-virgin olive oil. Add persil, mint, basil and rosemary in between.
7. Let the mackerel marinate for at least 3h, the more the tastier.
8. Add the mackerel to a salad bowl, with some capers and lemon slices.
9. By the way, salad is just an option: you could eat it on a bruschetta, as pasta sauce or straight from the casserole!
